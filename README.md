# Ethical BioSelector

Your gateway to discovering cutting-edge, animal-free testing models.

## About

Ethical BioSelector is a web-based tool designed to help students and researchers find suitable biological testing models that utilize cutting-edge methodologies as alternatives to animal testing. This project was created by Kavindu Munugoda as part of the SLALAS (Sri Lanka Association for Laboratory Animal Science) review paper writing competition.

## Purpose

The primary goals of Ethical BioSelector are to:

1. Promote ethical research practices
2. Reduce reliance on animal testing
3. Showcase innovative, animal-free testing models
4. Educate students and researchers about alternative testing models
5. Facilitate the adoption of more ethical and advanced research techniques

## Features

- Comprehensive database of animal-free testing models
- User-friendly search interface
- Detailed information on each testing model, including:
  - Methodology description
  - Applications
  - Advantages and limitations
  - References to relevant scientific literature
- Comparison tools to evaluate different testing models
- Regular updates to include the latest advancements in the field
- Access to SLALAS guidelines
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
